This project is a response to a developer test.

It delivers a React based web site for a company Your Health.

I chose to use a React approach to show some of my React skills to deliver a simple application, although a real world application would not be coded in this manner 
	-	it would use a somthing like to Redux to connect to a data store for controlling state.


To view the site clone this repo.
Assuming you have node.js installed
navigate to the folder containing the site, use npm start

alternatively, you place build\static on a server and browse to index.html
